## 🧩 What It Does
Quiet Zone Time adjusts your device's audio settings based on your location:
- Define geographic “quiet zones” using an interactive map
- Automatically silence or vibrate on entry
- Restore normal sound when exiting

## ⚙️ Features
- Map-based creation, resizing, and removal of zones
- GPS-based detection of user movement
- Toggleable behavior: silent, vibrate, or fully active
